Write a C program that prints a horizontal histogram of the length of words in its input. However, ignore all words inside of C comments (/* … */). Ignore symbols as well. So for instance, “int main(void)” should be considered as three words “int”, “main”, and “void”. Stand-alone special characters should be ignored as well. So a “{“ by itself is ignored. For extra credit, create a vertical histogram instead.
